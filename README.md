This code should be run in Google colab platform.

Before running it:
First, you need to upload the data file into colab. 
Second, you need to create a fold called "log" under the same directory, and then create a folder with the same name as your chosen model under "log" directory.
    --For example, if you're using "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", then the name of your folder should be "deepseek".
Finally, you need to create a fold called "saved_results" under the same directory, and then create a folder with the same name as your chosen model under "saved_results" directory.
    --For example, if you're using "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", then the name of your folder should be "deepseek".

Then, you can run the code without any problems. :)
