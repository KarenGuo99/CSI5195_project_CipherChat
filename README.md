This code should be run in **Google colab** platform.  
  
Before running it:  
**First**, you need to upload the **data** file "data_en_zh.dict" into colab.  
**Second**, you need to create a fold called "log" under the same directory, and then create a folder with the same name as your chosen model under "log" directory.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--For example, if you're using "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", then the name of your folder should be "deepseek".  
**Finally**, you need to create a fold called "saved_results" under the same directory, and then create a folder with the same name as your chosen model under "saved_results" directory.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--For example, if you're using "deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b", then the name of your folder should be "deepseek".  
  
Then, you can run the code without any problems. :)
